Imagine trying to allocate a 100000 x 100000 matrix of objects on any computer in a resident program (without using disk storage).  Can't be done. 
But with your knowledge of ArrayLists and LinkedLists, you can create a template that you and your company can use to do just that.

Design a generic class SparseMat<E> which implements a sparse matrix.  Use FHarrayList and FHlinkedList, only, as base ADTs on which to build your class.
